### Task: Vehicle Test ###

Download the provided Vehicle source file 

Create a new Java project in Eclipse or whatever IDE you're using.

Add the Vehicle class to your project.

Create a new class in your project. Name it something sensible. VehicleTest is a fine choice.

Create a main method in your new class.

Inside your main method:

Declare a Vehicle reference variable.
Instantiate a Vehicle object.
Assign the Vehicle object to the Vehicle reference variable.
Set the Vehicle object's year, miles, and mpg variables. 
Output to the screen the Vehicle's year, miles, and mpg values. Include some descriptive text so that we know what we're looking at.
Prompt the user to input the number of miles they will be driving the Vehicle.
Input from the keyboard the number of miles the Vehicle will be driven.
Drive the Vehicle object by calling the drive() method and moving it the number of miles that the user indicated.
Output to the screen the Vehicle's new miles value. Again, include descriptive text so that the output is sensible.

Complete the "Inside your main method" steps TWICE so that you are working with two separate Vehicle objects.
